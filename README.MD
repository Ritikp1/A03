How to Set Up GitHub/Git/WebStorm and how to use them.


Github is used as an online open source version control system. Github is used to make organization of source codes or other documents easier.

When creating a GitHub account, you need an email address and create a password.

To make an account, head over to the following link:
https://github.com/join.

You can download Webstorm using the following link:
https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ 

Students have accesss to it for free for educational purposes.
(Make sure to download the correct version for your OS).

You can download Git using the following link: 
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Glossary


*__Branch__: A copy of a repository that are in two fifferent places at the same time. It is inside the repository, but has no effects on the primary or main branch. this allows you to work freely without causing any disruptions to the "live" version. Once you are done making any change, merge your branch back into the main branch to publish them.

*__Clone__: A copy of a repository which is on your computer not on a website's server. You could modify the files in an editor and use Git to keep track of any changes without having to be online when you make a copy. The remote version of the repository you copyed is still connected, which allows you to push your local modifications to the remote to maintain them in sync all while you are online.

*__Commit__: Also know as "revision", is an individual change to a file. When saveing your work, Git creates a unique ID that allows you to keep track of the specific changes made along with who made them and when they were made. It also contains a message which is a brief description of what changes were made.

*__Fetch__: The action of adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them when you use git fetch. Fetching also allows you to evaluate changes before committing them to your local branch.

*__Git__: A free and open source application that allows you to track changes in text files. It was created by the creator of the Linux operating system. A social and user interface platform.

*__GitHub__: GitHub Online can provide service to corporations and individuals. It can be installed and also allowed access online to certain repositories directly on organizations and individual accounts. GitHub allows the proper organization of source code and corresponding files.

*__Merge__: The process of applying changes from one branch to another. This is frequently done via a "pull request" or the command line. If there are no conflicting changes, a merging can be done through the GitHub.com web interface or through the command line.

*__Merge Conflict__: A distinction that arises between branches that have been combined. Usually occur when two people make different modifications to the same line of a file, or when one person modifies a file while the other deletes it. Before you can merge the branches, you must settle the merge conflict.

*__Push__: Pushing your commits to a remote repository on GitHub.com is referred to as "pushing." When you make a modification locally, you can push it out to others.

*__Pull__: Integrating changes is referred to as “pulling”. If your partner or someone has made modifications to the remote file you're both working on, you would most likley want to update your local copy.

*__Remote__: A server-hosted version of a repository or branch. Changes can be synchronized by connecting remote versions to local clones.

*__Repository__: Somewhat like project folders. Holds all of the project files including the revision history for each file. Multiple collaborators are allowed in repositories, which may be public or private.
